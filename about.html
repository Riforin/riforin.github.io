          <h1>Hi, I'm William.</h1>
          <p>
              Welcome to my website! I'm a hobbyist software developer based in Berkeley, California. I am a third year Chemical Engineering major and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Minor at U.C. Berkeley. I have interests in mobile, web, and game development. <br> <br>

        <h1 id = "entry-header-right">Skills</h1>
        I am most comfortable coding in Java, Python, and C. In terms of web development, I have worked with HTML, CSS, Django, and Javascript. I am also familiar with scripting in Matlab, dynamic modelling using Matlab, and CAD software such as SolidWorks. For game production, I mainly use Java with the LibGDX framework, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for Graphics, and FLStudio for music and sound.

              <h1 id = "entry-header-left">Star Bird</h1>
              This actually started out as a game where the protagonist was a reactive particle. After experimenting with the art style and multiple redesigns, we settled on a bird in space escaping cats. Jukyung Choi handled the coding while I handled the art and UI/UX. Learned a lot about the advantages and shortcomings of the Android lifecycle.

    <div class = "game-desc" id = "game-desc-right">
      <div>
          <h1 id = "entry-header-right">Mighty Moon</h1>

          Originally named Mega Moon Madness, this was the first game that I've ever released to the Android Play store. Katamari Damacy has always had a special place in my heart and this game was inspired by it. I decided to challenge myself to code, develop the art, and the music for this game within two weeks. After many sleepless nights, Mighty Moon was born.
